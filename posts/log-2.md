It's been four long years since I **imprisoned Walter White in a bubble on the Next.js tutorial website.** Sometimes, I think about how my life would have been different if I hadn't **imprisoned Walter White on the Next.js tutorial page,** but I've decided not to live my life with regrets. In all honesty, **imprisoning Walter White on the Next.js tutorial page** was one of the greatest things I've ever done, and it's led to my development as a person.

Anyways yesterday this little yellow thing broke into my house and I set it on fire, and now I have this intense urge to burn down my house with **Walter White imprisoned on the Next.js tutorial page** inside. Does anyone have any suggestions?
